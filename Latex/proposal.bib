  abstract = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z $>$ 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

  abstract = {The study will investigate the concepts of science communication and its benefits. Being good communicators in general will help scientists to be better science communicators in order to:\textbullet{}help the public understand science as part of their real lives,\textbullet{}see not only the importance of the science and its source of pleasure and wonder, but also to be able to make decisions about it as citizens, policymakers, funders, etc.\textbullet{}help in educating citizenry, concerned about the threats facing our planet to better shape the direction of political and policy decisions, because how scientists communicate this information may have measurable conservation impacts on the future of our planet. More than ever, scientists are called upon to provide assessments, often to non-scientists, on which management policies are built and experts should consider becoming more involved and effective in raising public awareness of these threats. Traditional scientific training doesn't typically prepare scientists to be effective communicators outside academic circles. For scientists, the most important aspect might be how something fits into the given body of research, whereas, the public wants to know how a new finding might impact their lives. By considering the needs of the public audience versus a scientific one, by crafting an appropriate message, and communicating it clearly, more scientists will be more effective at bringing the world of science to the general public. The research methodology was the assessment of the information channels from the literature and the authors' studies. There are many interesting and innovative ways of communicating complicated concepts and the aim of the paper was to present some rules that can be applied to assure that we (scientists and public) are talking the same language, with the purpose to help promote a better understanding of issues facing our lives, thereby stimulating wise and timely action to save what belongs to us all.},
