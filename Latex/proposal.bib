  title = {Entropy and Disorder Enable Charge Separation in Organic Solar Cells},
  abstract = {Although organic heterojunctions can separate charges with near-unity efficiency and on a sub-picosecond timescale, the full details of the charge-separation process remain unclear. In typical models, the Coulomb binding between the electron and the hole can exceed the thermal energy \$k\_$\backslash$mathrm\{B\}T\$ by an order of magnitude, making it impossible for the charges to separate before recombining. Here, we consider the entropic contribution to charge separation in the presence of disorder and find that even modest amounts of disorder have a decisive effect, reducing the charge-separation barrier to about \$k\_$\backslash$mathrm\{B\}T\$ or eliminating it altogether. Therefore, the charges are usually not thermodynamically bound at all and could separate spontaneously if the kinetics otherwise allowed it. Our conclusion holds despite the worst-case assumption of localised, thermalised carriers, and is only strengthened if mechanisms like delocalisation or `hot' states are also present.},

In 1-D materials, the change in entropy, $\Delta$S, plays no role, but at higher dimensions, it leads to a substantial decrease in the Coulomb barrier for charge separation. The effects of $\Delta$S are highest in equilibrium systems but decrease and become time-dependent in illuminated organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Higher-dimensional semiconductors have inherent advantages for charge separation, and this may be one reason that C60 and its derivatives, the only truly three-dimensional organic semiconductors yet known, play such an important role in OPV cells.},

In state-of-the-art devices, above 80\% of all polaron pairs are separated at fields of below 107 V/m. In contrast, considering just the Coulomb binding of the polaron pair, electric fields above 108 V/m would be needed to reach similar yields. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of polaron-pair dissociation in donor-acceptor blends, considering delocalized charge carriers along conjugated polymer chain segments. We show that the resulting fast local charge carrier transport can indeed explain the high experimental quantum yields in polymer solar cells.},

By tracking the modulation of the optical absorption due to the electric field generated between the charges, we measure \textasciitilde{}200 millielectron volts of electrostatic energy arising from electron-hole separation within 40 femtoseconds of excitation, corresponding to a charge separation distance of at least 4 nanometers. At this separation, the residual Coulomb attraction between charges is at or below thermal energies, so that electron and hole separate freely. This early time behavior is consistent with charge separation through access to delocalized $\pi$-electron states in ordered regions of the fullerene acceptor material.},

  abstract = {Strong Coulomb interactions in organic photovoltaic cells dictate that charges must separate over relatively long distances in order to circumvent geminate recombination and produce photocurrent. In this article, we measure the distance distributions of thermalized charge pairs by accessing a regime at low temperature where charge pairs are frozen out following the primary charge separation step and recombine monomolecularly via tunneling. The exponential attenuation of tunneling rate with distance provides a sensitive probe of the distance distribution of primary charge pairs, reminiscent of electron transfer studies in proteins. By fitting recombination dynamics to distributions of recombination rates, we identified populations of charge-transfer states and well-separated charge pairs. For the wide range of materials we studied, the yield of separated charges in the tunneling regime is strongly correlated with the yield of free charges measured via their intensity-dependent bimolecular recombination dynamics at room temperature. We therefore conclude that populations of free charges are established via long-range charge separation within the thermalization time scale, thus invoking early branching between free and bound charges across an energetic barrier. Subject to assumed values of the electron tunneling attenuation constant, we estimate critical charge separation distances of $\sim$3\textendash{}4 nm in all materials. In some blends, large fullerene crystals can enhance charge separation yields; however, the important role of the polymers is also highlighted in blends that achieved significant charge separation with minimal fullerene concentration. We expect that our approach of isolating the intrinsic properties of primary charge pairs will be of considerable value in guiding new material development and testing the validity of proposed mechanisms for long-range charge separation.},

In state-of-the-art devices, above 80\% of all polaron pairs are separated at fields of below 107 V/m. In contrast, considering just the Coulomb binding of the polaron pair, electric fields above 108 V/m would be needed to reach similar yields. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of polaron-pair dissociation in donor-acceptor blends, considering delocalized charge carriers along conjugated polymer chain segments. We show that the resulting fast local charge carrier transport can indeed explain the high experimental quantum yields in polymer solar cells.},

Atomistic modeling showed that the IR photons promote bound charge pairs to delocalized band states, similar to those formed just after singlet exciton dissociation, which indicates that such states act as the gateway for charge separation. Our results suggest that charge separation in efficient organic photoconversion systems occurs through hot-state charge delocalization rather than energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping.},

In this spirit, we present a rather straightforward and inexpensive experimental setup and the associated spectral analysis which provides an excellent exercise of applied quantum mechanics fit for advanced laboratory courses.

  abstract = {1. A detailed study of cytochrome c oxidase activity with Keilin-Hartree particles and purified beef heart enzyme, at low ionic strength and low cytochrome c concentrations, showed biphasic kinetics with apparent Km1 = 5 x 10(-8) M, and apparent Km2 = 0.35 to 1.0 x 10(-6) M. Direct binding studies with purified oxidase, phospholipid-containing as well as phospholiptaining aid-depleted, demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme, with KD1 less than or equal to 10(-7) M, and KD2 = 10(-6) M. 2. The maximal velocities as low ionic strength increased with pH and were highest above ph 7.5. 3. The presence and properties of the low apparent Km phase of the kinetics were strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions in the medium. The multivalent anions, phosphate, ADP, and ATP, greatly decreased the proportion of this phase and similarly decreased the amount of high affinity cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase complex formed. The order of effectiveness was ATP greater than ADP greater than P1 and since phosphate binds to cytochrome c more strongly than the nucleotides, it is concluded that the inhibition resulted from anion interaction with the oxidase. 4mat low concentrations bakers' yeast iso-1, bakers' yeast iso-1, horse, and Euglena cytochromes c at high concentrations all attained the same maximal velocity. The different proportions of low apparent Km phase in the kinetic patterns of these cytochromes c correlated with the amounts of high affinity complex formed with purified cytochrome c oxidase. 5. The apparent Km for cytochrome c activity in the succinate-cytochrome c reductase system of Keilin-Hartree particles was identical with that obtained with the oxidase (5 x 10(-8) M), suggesting the same site serves both reactions. 6. It is concluded that the observed kinetics result from two catalytically active sites on the cytochrome c oxidase protein of different affinities for cytochrome c. The high affinity binding of cytochrome c to the mitochondrial membrane is provided by the oxidase and at this site cytochrome c can be reduced by cytochrome c1. Physiological concentrations of ATP decrease the affinity of this binding to the point that interaction of cytochrome c with numerous mitochondrial pholpholipid sites can competitively remove cytochrome c from the oxidase. It is suggested that this effect of ATP represents a possible mechanism for the control of electron flow to the oxidase.},

For the differentiation of amines, adrenaline was oxidized at pH 2.85 and noradrenaline at pH 7. Precision, accuracy, sensitivity and specifity fulfilled the criteria of analysis. The normal values, determined in a collective of 17 healthy persons, were adrenaline (x +/- s) 44.8 +/- 16.9 nmol/24 h and noradrenaline (x +/- s) 224.0 +/- 68.0 nmol/24h.

A single adult female of M. annulatus caused 51.6\% and 52.3\% mortality of 50 first instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens respectively, in a 72 h test period. When alternative food was added to the containers, mortality rates declined to 16\% and 10.3\% for Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens respectively. When 50 first instar larvae of each of the two mosquito species tested were placed together with a single adult female of M. annulatus, mortality rates were 75.5\% for Ae. aegypti larvae and 23.5\% for Cx. pipiens larvae in a three day test period. Different density of adult females of M. annulatus ranged from 5 to 25 females produced mortality rates of Ae. aegypti first instar larvae from 50\% to 100\% respectively. When a single adult female of M. annulatus was exposed to an increasing number of first-instar Ae. aegypti larvae ranging from 10 to 100, 100\% mortality was recorded from 1 to 25 larvae, then mortality declined to 30\% with 100 larvae. The average larvae killed per 24 h period by a single copepod were 29.},

  volume = {229},
  issn = {0002-9513},
  abstract = {Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4\% with nitrate loading and 14.4\% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1\%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6\%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.},

Also, the rate of appearance of the virions was studied in cell culture and the host insect to determine maximum virion production. Virions obtained from both sources were heat-sensitive, acid-labile and inactivated by several organic solvents. The non-occluded virions found in the insect cell culture fluid and in the hemolymph were identical, and both were enveloped nucleocapsids. Visualization of the fragilely enveloped nucleocapsid was accomplished only after fixation with glutaraldehyde. Differences between the non-occluded and occluded virions of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are discussed.},

  abstract = {Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.},

The rubidium ground-state atoms of the naturally abundant isotope 85Rb were excited with a narrow-band dye-laser beam, and the resulting (relative) fluorescence was measured as a function of the temperature of the cell. At a fixed temperature of 296.6 K the absorption of the laser beam at the top of the absorption profile was measured. When the calculated cross section for photon absorption was used, the absolute density was determined and related to the corresponding fluorescence signal. The measurements permit the determination of the heat of vaporization, 82.3 $\pm$ 0.3 kJ mol-1.},

Statistical fluctuations (photon noise) of the CMB itself will be the major limitation to the sensitivity of the CMB channels. Higher frequency channels will measure galactic foregrounds. Together with the Low Frequency Instrument, this will make a unique tool to measure the full sky and to separate the various components of its spectrum. Measurement of the polarization of these various components will give a new picture of the CMB. In addition, HFI will provide the scientific community with new full sky maps of intensity and polarization at six frequencies, with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. This paper describes the logics that prevailed to define the HFI and the performances expected from this instrument. It details several features of the HFI design that have not been published up to now.},

The independence of the thermal noise from the material nature of the sensor makes it particularly attractive for metrological applications. However, the noise signals are extremely small and some ingenuity is required to make accurate measurements. This paper reviews the foundations of Johnson noise thermometry and the various techniques that have been employed to measure temperature via Johnson noise. Emphasis is placed on key developments in noise thermometers for metrological applications. The review includes the current activities of teams involved in noise thermometry research.},

  abstract = {There is a longstanding debate about the zero-point term in the Johnson noise voltage of a resistor. This term originates from a quantum-theoretical treatment of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). Is the zero-point term really there, or is it only an experimental artefact, due to the uncertainty principle, for phase-sensitive amplifiers? Could it be removed by renormalization of theories? We discuss some historical measurement schemes that do not lead to the effect predicted by the FDT, and we analyse new features that emerge when the consequences of the zero-point term are measured via the mean energy and force in a capacitor shunting the resistor. If these measurements verify the existence of a zero-point term in the noise, then two types of perpetual motion machines can be constructed. Further investigation with the same approach shows that, in the quantum limit, the Johnson-Nyquist formula is also invalid under general conditions even though it is valid for a resistor-antenna system. Therefore we conclude that and a satisfactory quantum theory of the Johnson noise, the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, must, as a minimum, include also the measurement system used to evaluate the observed quantities. Issues concerning the zero-point term may also have implications for phenomena in advanced nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z $>$ 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},
